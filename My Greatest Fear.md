Hi there ...
 *Intro to greatest Fear;
 This is my worst fear that impacts my internal emotions or feelings. This happens to my self in a negative and postive ways, whcih this sometimes can inspire and disappoint my actions after the impaction.
 *My actual greatest fear;
 my main greatest fear in life is when when speaking or having a speech in my presentation towards a lot of people. This literally makes me lose control infront of the audience due to lack of confidence maintained by myself.
 *Causes for my greatest fear;
Myself thinks that I will make some unexpected errors and can badly judged by others (feeling criticized by several people).
*Overcoming my greatest fear;
Following the footsteps of the professional speakers in the world. This gains my self confidence experiences and help me move forward with a postive mindest towards my future demonstration speech.
